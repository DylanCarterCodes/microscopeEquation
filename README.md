 *  When variables are defined I'm usually using one of 2 datatypes, double or int
 *  int is short for integer, and an int can be any whole number from 2147483648 to 2147483647
 *  double is a number type that can have up to 2^64 digits and so is very accurate 
 *  Even into very very small numbers. That's why I used it for calculus
